# Big Bad Records v.1


A complete, dark-themed static site for Big Bad Records. Inspired by Bandcamp artist grids and Holy Mountain merch walls, with tasteful motion accents.


## Features
- Accessible HTML5 structure (skip link, focus styles, alt text discipline)
- Responsive grids for artists, releases, and products
- Client-side search/filter (artists & releases)
- Subtle animations with `prefers-reduced-motion` support
- Zero backend: pure HTML/CSS/JS
- Easy GitHub Pages deployment


## Quick Start
1) Add your images to `assets/` (see list at bottom).
2) Edit copy in each HTML file (titles, headings, text).
3) Commit/push to GitHub repo root (`AngelaSlamsbury/bigbad`).
4) Enable GitHub Pages: Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → `main` / `/ (root)`.
5) Live at: https://angelaslamsbury.github.io/bigbad/


## Local Dev
